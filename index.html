   <p id="about me"> About me </p>
     <p>I attended primary school at<em> Kerugoya Goodshepherd's Academy</em> in Kerugoya.I later joined <em> Kagumo High School</em> in Nyeri and did my K.C.S.E in the year 2018.I have not yet got any kind of job but i am partly a free-lance artist.</p>
      <p>I decided to join Moringa school and pursue a course on programming because i was passionate about it.I also wanted to get a good job while still schooling in campus.</p>
   <p>I love painting,drawing and all types of <strong> art </strong> in general.I love being <strong> creative </strong> by creating my own things which I usually adore.I love watching movies;I love comedy.I enjoy listening to good music.I am an organised, hard-working guy and I am currently interested in web-designing in which i believe i will be a great web-designer.</p>
